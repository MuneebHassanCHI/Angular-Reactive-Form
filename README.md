#### Quality comes with Quanity.
So let's create form to get more quality.

The task I was assigned, is to create form like below.

#### Assuming you have installed Angular 8 or above

First thing first, I created project called my-app

```
ng new my-app
```

After that, I created a component where I'll add my all code related to forms.

```
ng generate form
```
